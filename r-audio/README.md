# r-audio

A library of React components for building [Web Audio](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) graphs.

## Objectives

ðŸ‘‰ make Web Audio graph code more readable and representative of the graph shape

ðŸ‘‰ make it easier to create reusable graphs

ðŸ‘‰ make state management easier with React's one-way data bindings and single source of state

ðŸ‘‰ represent any arbitrary directed graphs in JSX

ðŸ‘‰ support all non-deprecated audio nodes including `AudioWorklet`

ðŸ‘‰ allow interspersed HTML components in audio components

## Installation

```bash
npm install r-audio
```

## Usage example

Stereo waveshaper + amplitude modulation on a WAV loop

```jsx
<RAudioContext debug={true} onInit={(ctx) => (this.audioContext = ctx)}>
  <RPipeline>
    <RBufferSource buffer={this.state.buffer} loop />
    <RSplitChannels channelCount={2}>
      <RPipeline>
        <RWaveShaper curve={this.makeDistortionCurve(200)} />
        <RConvolver buffer={this.state.buffer} />
        <RDynamicsCompressor threshold={-50} knee={40} />
        <RGain gain={0.5} />
      </RPipeline>
      <RPipeline>
        <ROscillator
          frequency={1}
          type="sine"
          detune={0}
          connectToParam="gain"
        />
        <RGain gain={1} />
      </RPipeline>
    </RSplitChannels>
  </RPipeline>
</RAudioContext>
```

## Development setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The demo page will be served at `localhost:8080`. Use a recent version of Chrome or Firefox for the best experience.

Firefox Web Audio developer tool is especially handy (bear in mind Firefox does not support AudioWorklet as of 17 April 2018).
