[Demo](https://dazzling-jang-471a34.netlify.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And based on https://codepen.io/alexdevp/full/RNELPV - Alex Permyakov

## About the Project

A web player build with react and web audio api.

The layout was inspired by `Alex Permyakov` example in codepen and the audio processing was write from zero.

The player loads the song with `web streams` to give a better experience to user and improve performance;

The project is open source and can be used as example of `web audio api and canvas visualization`.
